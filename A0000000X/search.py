"""
In order to collect the vocabulary, you need to apply tokenization and stemming on the document text. You should use the NLTK tokenizers (nltk.sent_tokenize() and nltk.word_tokenize()) to tokenize sentences and words, and the NLTK Porter stemmer (class nlkt.stem.porter) to do stemming. You need to do case-folding to reduce all words to lower case.
